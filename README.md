## Frontend

The frontend is a Next.js app located in the `frontend/` folder. The homepage has been refactored into modular React components under `frontend/app/components/`:

- `Header.js` â€” top navigation and hero header
- `Hero.js` â€” stats section
- `HowItWorks.js` â€” explanation and image
- `Pricing.js` â€” pricing cards
- `Testimonials.js` â€” user testimonials
- `FAQ.js` â€” frequently asked questions

To run the frontend locally:

1. cd into the frontend folder
2. Install dependencies with your preferred package manager (npm or pnpm)
3. Run the dev server:

	npm run dev

Or with pnpm:

	pnpm dev

The root route (`/`) now composes the modular components to render the landing page.
